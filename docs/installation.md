Installation
============

Requirements
------------

* PHP 8.4 or newer

If you want to use it with a version earlier than PHP 8.4, please use one of the previous versions that suits your needs: [v5](https://github.com/forxer/gravatar/tree/5.x), [v4](https://github.com/forxer/gravatar/tree/4.x), [v3](https://github.com/forxer/gravatar/tree/3.x), [v2](https://github.com/forxer/gravatar/tree/2.1) or [v1](https://github.com/forxer/gravatar/tree/1.3).

With Composer
-------------

The easiest way to install Gravatar is via [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/). Run the following command in the root of your project:

```
composer require forxer/Gravatar
```

Without Composer
----------------

You should use composer, it's so convenient. However, if you really do not want, or can not, you can
[download the latest version](https://github.com/forxer/gravatar/releases/latest) and unpack the archive.

Then, you do what it takes to use it with your own autoloader. The examples below use the Composer autoloader.
